Minor mode for typographic editing.

This is a minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the `Typo
mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive, enable the mode,
and if it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable
the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate `typo-mode'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when
it is disabled.

This mode changes some default keybindings to enter typographic
glyphs. In particular, this changes how quotation marks, the
dash, the dot, and the angle brackets work.

Most keys will cycle through various options when used
repeatedly.

Minor mode for typographic editing.

This is a minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`Typo-Global mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive,
enable the mode, and if it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable
the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate `(default-value \\='typo-global-mode)'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when
it is disabled.

This mode provides a prefix map under C-c 8 which complements the
default C-x 8 prefix map.
